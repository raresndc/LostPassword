You have breached the adversary database and got its password hashvalue. The hash value is 
given in the attached file (check the table for your name)  
You know that your adversary is using one of the most 10 million used passwords available here 
https://weakpass.com/wordlist/1935 (ignis-10M.txt) 
You also know that they are using a technique that will make your rainbow tables useless 
because they add “ismsap” as a prefix to all user passwords and after that they hash them 2 
times using MD5 (1st run) and SHA 256 (2nd run). The output from the MD5 step is hashed 
again with SHA 256.  
Write a simple Java application that will brute force the adversary password. The Java solution 
should contain a single .java file. The package name must contain your name. The Java solution 
must print the corresponding password at the console.  
Benchmark the solution by printing the number of milliseconds require to do this. To measure 
the performance, you can use the next sequence 
long tstart = System.currentTimeMillis();  
//do the brute force 
long tfinal = System.currentTimeMillis();  
System.out.println("Duration is : " + (tfinal-tstart));  
When you upload the solution fill up the response box with - - 
The password 
The duration in miliseconds 
All the solutions will be cross-checked with MOSS from Stanford. Solutions with a similarity of 
more than 50% will be canceled.
